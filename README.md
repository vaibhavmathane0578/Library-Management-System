# Project Title: College Library Management
In this project, I am going to create a Web application to manage Library Information using Java, JDBC 
Approach: Implement the below feature in your application. 
1. Student Registration. 
2. Book Management: Add a new book, delete a book, update a book's details,
 and search a book.
3. Allow students a maximum of 15 days to borrow the book. If the book is not 
 returned within 15 days, calculate the fine. One day equals ten rupees. 
4. Limit each pupil to three books. 
5. Enable book searches by author, title, and category. 
6. Registration of librarians 
7. Any Librarian may issue books to any student. 
<!--8.You can also create your own functions.-->
